title: Implement Codex app-server chapter generation with account sign-in
priority: 0
labels: agents, provider

## User outcome
The user connects an eligible ChatGPT account once and generates chapters through Codex without configuring a direct API key for each workflow.

## Research decision — 2026-10-15
Use official Codex app-server over Rust-managed stdio. OpenAI documents Sign in with ChatGPT for eligible open-source apps and Plus/Pro plan usage. Dynamic public-client registration and PKCE do not require a partner API key/client secret. Establish this project's open-source distribution eligibility/license and pin a runtime supporting the required schema. The old installed runtime described in prior research is not proof that current app-server lacks these controls.

## Contract
Add an Agent runtime category alongside Direct API. Connect/disconnect with the documented browser OAuth flow, app attribution and native token storage/refresh. Read account-entitled models; combine with pinned runtime capability metadata for supported reasoning values. Show effective model, effort, approval policy and immutable source manifest before a run. Launch one managed app-server child, with app-owned configuration and no additional listener/Node daemon. Request the existing chapter output schema and route successful output through local source/citation validation to an unaccepted draft.

Use restricted read-only staging, explicitly disable command execution and web/unrelated tools, and do not load repository instructions/plugins. Read-only access alone is not a no-command policy. Begin with bounded reviewed evidence passed directly; expand investigation with app-owned read/search tools. Implement progress, turn/interrupt, exit/reap, refresh/restart/resume and late-result guards. No automatic direct API fallback.

## Acceptance criteria
- Eligible account login and one real chapter run require no API key; plan limits/eligibility and account route are clear.
- Account-entitled model discovery controls choices; unsupported effort/approval values cannot be silently ignored.
- OAuth secrets stay outside WebView, repository files, exports and logs; expiry/logout are recoverable.
- Exact selected context is staged; supported runtime tool controls and sandbox enforce the declared boundary.
- Structured output is independently validated; invalid claims cannot become accepted chapters.
- Progress/cancel/quota/refresh/crash states preserve prior history and no orphan process remains.
- Update matrix from candidate to supported only with pinned-version packaged evidence when testing is authorized.

## Excludes
ACP wrappers without need, token scraping, paid fallback, speech synthesis through this account route and an extra Node server.

## Done evidence
Documented auth integration, versioned adapter/configuration, complete source-grounded chapter workflow and later account/cancel/permission acceptance.
